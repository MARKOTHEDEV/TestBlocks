   - Click the "Pick" button next to "Target Element"
   - **Switch to the sample site tab** and click the email field
   - The `qaId` should auto-fill in the builder!

### 3. Create a Simple Test

1. **Add blocks in this order:**
   - "Go to URL" → set URL to `http://localhost:5174`
   - "Fill Input" → pick email field, set value to `test@example.com`
   - "Fill Input" → pick password field, set value to `password`
   - "Click Element" → pick the "Sign In" button
   - "Expect Visible" → pick the "Dashboard" heading

2. **Run the test live:**
   - Click the **"▶️ Run Test"** button in the header
   - Watch your test execute step-by-step in the live preview!
   - See the progress bar and step-by-step execution

3. **Export the test:**
   - Click "Export JSON" then "Download Spec"

4. **Run with Playwright:**
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter runner test:spec ~/Downloads/your-test.json
   ```
